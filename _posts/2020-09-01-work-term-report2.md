<h3 style="color:#e62555;">INTRODUCTION</h3>

The following should showcase my experience doing my 3rd work term with the Co-operators and what was new for me starting off with extensive RPA experience from my previous work terms. This is a reflection of my Summer 2020 co-op work term.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">What is RPA?</h3>

If you have read my previous report, you would know that RPA uses AI to automate business tasks that would otherwise be unautomatable due to the lack of APIs available for the program(s) used for the task. At the Co-operators, the RPA solution we use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UiPath"> UiPath</a>, which is at cutting edge of RPA solutions.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">EMPLOYER INFORMATION</h3>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operators"> Co-operators </a> is a Canadian insurance co-operative. They own several companies and are consistently ranked as one of Canada's best employers. This work term, instead of working in an office, I had to work from home the entirety of my summer semester which was certainly an interesting experience.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">JOB DESCRIPTION</h3>

My work generally involved supporting and developing automation processes for various departments across the Co-operators. My team also administered the UiPath solution we used and I was frequently responsible for initiating new departments to our automation solution, managing permissions, responding to inqueries, auditing our processes, and helping other develpment teams with their automations.

We used Agile Kanban for our team's tasks. My first large project involved rewriting a moderately complex automation project that takes two different input sources. The automation had to be done uregently as it was needed for processing thousands of files. This was helped me manage coding under a fairly stressful environment and a looming deadline. At the end, the success rate of the process increased from ~30% when I was handed the process to over 96%! Error reporting was vastly improved as well which resulted in better handling and fixes of invalid files and other error's from the business department's side. The time and efficiency savings were very significant and displayed in our tracked metrics.

Just like in my last work term, where I was the first to develop an "attended" process. Towards the end of my work term, I was also the first to develop a process that automated a terminal, specifically AS400. I was introduced to the terminal library of UiPath and added one more skill to my RPA skillset.

Working entirely from home was a new experience for me as I loved going to the office and the general atmosphere that it provided. However, the transition was not a problem for me and there were a few advantages as well. Firstly, instead of eating out, I could cook during my lunch break or take a shower. Also, there was no time wasted during transportation to and from work! Would I always work from home if I had the chance to? Likely not. I missed in-person interaction with my team and the office. Maybe a balance exists and I would be happiest going to the office a couple time per week.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">GOALS</h3>

For my first goal, I wanted to improve my peer-reviewing skills, which I was able to do with great success this work term. I was provided several opportunities to work directly with a consultant with extensive RPA experience, in addition to my code peer-reviews that I have done with my members of my team and also other developing teams. I have gained new prespectives on what to look for during peer-review and also how I can improve my general code design.


I also vastly improved my communication skills despite not having in-person conversations. I worked with many departments and talked to a lot of people with a great range of skills and technical knowledge. Professional communication is always something I am working on and I am glas this work term had another positive effect in this area.

For my final project I worked in close relation with a consultant to on a process that needed to be up and running before the end of my work-term. This provided me the opportunity to learn many skills and techniques that would improve my code and problem solving while minimising errors. The project got to a 90% completion state before I left and from what I know is now running without issues!

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">CONCLUSION</h3>

Working again with the Co-operators was a great experience and I definately learned and contributed a lot during my 4 months.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">Acknowledgements</h3>

I would like to thank my team members Zaman Chagani, Connor Rieger, Jean-Francois Gingras and especially my manager Virna Uliana. I also extend my gratitude to all the people from the different departments that I had the joy of working with and I am grateful everyone was so understanding and compassionate with everyone's work from home situation.
