INTRODUCTION

The following should showcase the experience I gained working as an RPA developer for the co-operators and what I learned.

I mainly worked with RPA (robotics process automation) during my co-op work term.

What is RPA?
RPA is the use of software with AI capabilities to automate business tasks through the front-end, just like how a human would do it. It works b RPA handles high-volume, repeatable tasks the best.


Employer Information
I worked at the Co-operators Headquarters which is located in downtown Guelph. The co-operators is a Canadian insurance co-operative. My team was the eRPA Capability Team which is the team that manages the RPA solution. We often worked with the two other RPA teams within The Co-operators as well.


Goals
My first goal was to be able to design automation processes that are based on automating front-ends as opposed to using an api. This poses several challenges as user interfaces can change in unpredictable ways. Over time through developing and maintaining processes I learned what makes reliable selectors which came in handy when a one of our longest processes had to be updated on short notice due to an update being pushed to the system being automated.

I also improved my data visualization skills and figuring out how different users interact with user interfaces. When I was finalizing a company-wide available dashboard I created I decided to run an experiment to figure out how they should look (mention kibana above/before) I asked people on my floor to come over to my desk and try to navigate the dashboard without providing them with any instructions. Then, I would implement changes based on their feedback and bring over a different person and watch them try to navigate it and implement more changes based on that. This taught me that some things that might seem intuitive to me especially when it comes to user interfaces might not be for others even people who work in IT. That final dashboard has been and still is used to track metrics about processes we automate and my manager used it several times to create reports required from her.
