<h3 style="color:#e62555;">INTRODUCTION</h3>

The following should showcase my experience doing my 4th and 5th work term with the Co-operators and the projects I worked on having extensive RPA experience. This is a reflection of my winter and summer 2021 co-op work terms.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">What is RPA?</h3>

RPA uses AI to automate business tasks that would otherwise be unautomatable due to the lack of APIs available for the program(s) used for the task. At the Co-operators, the RPA solution we use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UiPath"> UiPath</a>, which is at cutting edge of RPA solutions.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">EMPLOYER INFORMATION</h3>

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Co-operators"> Co-operators </a> is a Canadian insurance co-operative. They own several companies and are consistently ranked as one of Canada’s best employers. This work term, instead of working in an office, I had to work from home the entirety of my winter and summer co-op terms which I got used to since I also worked from home for my 2020 summer co-op term.

<h3 style="color:#e62554;">JOB DESCRIPTION</h3>

I mainly worked on supporting automations and updating them to maintain compatibility with the latest system updates. I also worked on developing proof of concepts and investigating whether certain automations that have not been attempted before could be possible using UiPath or if a different solution would be needed. I worked on implementing new features to our solution such as UiPath Action Center and UiPath insights. I was also sometimes on-call if other members of the team are not available.

We used Agile Kanban for our team’s tasks. For one of my projects, I worked on automating a task that required pdf processing and the challenge was finding a way to add keywords to the pdf file itself so that it could be used to search for the pdf. I found a way to integrate the iTextSharp library to the automation which enabled this automation.

During my term, I worked on implementing “Action Center” which is a new UiPath feature that allowed automations to assign tasks to users and when the task is completed, the automation would continue using the output of the completed task. Previously “Human-in-the-loop” automations required users to run the automation locally and wait until they have to intervene. This saves time as the automation can run on a VM and the user can finish the task whenever.

I also worked on the determining the feasibility of moving our automation metrics from Kibana to UiPath insights. The worked involved creating visualizations and collecting metrics from our ElasticSearch. The work was significant and required getting used to a new system. However, we determined that the product was still in its early stages and would not be able to collect all our automation metrics. It was still a good experience and it’s good to know that in the real world not everything has to be feasible and it’s better to abandon a project for now that to fall to the “sunk-cost” fallacy.

The work from home experience this time was much smoother than Summer 2020. However, early on, I had hopes that maybe towards the end of my work term I would be able to return to office. As my work term progressed, I realised that this was a hopeless dream.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">GOALS</h3>

For my goals this work term, I mainly focused on getting exposed to new features and technicalities related to robotics process automation. I felt like my problem-solving skill and communication skills were already sufficient for the job.
I fulfilled my goal as I was exposed to various libraries and new features to get used to. I learned enough in this work term and previous work terms to consider myself an expert in UiPath.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">CONCLUSION</h3>

As usual, working again with the Co-operators was a great experience and I definitely learned and contributed a lot during my 8 months.

<h3 style="color:#e62555;">Acknowledgements</h3>

I would like to thank my team members Jean-Francois Gingras, Zoran Kubat, Sonali Aggarwal, Priyan Rajendhiran and especially my manager Virna Uliana. I also extend my gratitude to all the people from the different departments that I had the joy of working with and I am grateful everyone was so understanding and compassionate with everyone’s work from home situation.
